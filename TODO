Seed type -> Tree type -> Wood type
ContextMenu container for list of Buttons

BUGS:
- when zoomed in or out detection for mouse on buttons is innaccurate (fix should be done inside of display.camera.getRectVisualDimensions)
- when standaloneButtons are layered multiple are clickable
- when overlayButtons are layered multiple are clickable

FUTURE FEATURES:
- convert files to modules for cleaner importing
- reduce size of main.js by breaking into multiple files
